## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                # HTML templates (index.html)
â”œâ”€â”€ static/                   # CSS or JS assets
â”œâ”€â”€ resume_templates.txt      # (Optional) RAG data examples
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                      # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Dependencies

- Flask
- python-dotenv
- langchain
- langchain-google-genai
- langchain-community
- faiss-cpu
- numpy

#### Install them all with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

- API Key Error: Double-check that your GOOGLE_API_KEY is correct and has access to Gemini.
- FAISS installation issues: If you run into errors with faiss-cpu, try reinstalling or switching to faiss-gpu (if you have a compatible GPU).
- Port Conflict: Change the PORT in .env if 10000 is in use.

## How It Works

1. Resume examples from resume_examples.txt are loaded and chunked using CharacterTextSplitter.
2. These chunks are embedded with GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings and stored in FAISS for semantic search.
3. When a user submits input, the app searches for relevant examples from the vector store.
4. These examples + user input are sent to Gemini via a structured PromptTemplate.
5. Gemini returns a tailored resume, which is parsed and rendered in HTML.
